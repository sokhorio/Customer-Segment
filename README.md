# Customer Segmentation Analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using the RFM model — a powerful marketing analytics technique to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis was done using Python and visualized with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📊 About the Project

The RFM model classifies customers based on three key metrics:

* **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase
* **Frequency (F):** How often they purchase
* **Monetary (M):** How much they spend

Customers are scored from 1 to 5 for each metric and segmented into categories like:

* **Best Customers**
* **Loyal Customers**
* **New Customers**
* **At-Risk Customers**
* **Churned Customers**
